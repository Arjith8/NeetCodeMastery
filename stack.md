## Easy Questions

### Question 1.
- Goal: Valid Parentheses
- Link: https://neetcode.io/problems/validate-parentheses?list=neetcode150
- Observation:
    - Attempt 1:
        - Easy
        - Time Taken: 4:10m
        - Self Evaluation: Not worth doing again, but I did overlook some edge cases

## Medium Questions

### Question 1.
- Goal: Minimum Stack
- Link: https://neetcode.io/problems/minimum-stack?list=neetcode150
- Observation:
    - Attempt 1:
        - Easy
        - Time Taken: 8:42m
        - Self Evaluation: Not worth doing again, but I made some of the worst logical errors super lame dude

### Question 2.
- Goal: Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
- Link: https://neetcode.io/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation?list=neetcode150
- Observation:
    - Attempt 1:
        - Would have been somewhat easy but man I didnt realise a // b and int(float(a)/b) has different behavior
        - Time Taken: 14m
        - Self Evaluation: The truncate to 0 part is where I failed as a//b will always go for lower value but we have to move towards 0 so if -ve we have to go up and +ve then go down

### Question 3.
- Goal: Generate Parentheses
- Link: https://neetcode.io/problems/generate-parentheses?list=neetcode150
- Observation:
    - Attempt 1:
        - Couldnt figure it out try it once you reach backtracking
        - Time Taken: Nil
        - Self Evaluation: Backtracking is the main concept so lets come back then

### Question 4.
- Goal: Daily Temperatures
- Link: https://neetcode.io/problems/daily-temperatures?list=neetcode150
- Observation:
    - Attempt 1:
        - Couldnt figure it out
